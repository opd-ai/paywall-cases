CONCEPT 4: CODEX PROTOCOL
A technical documentation and knowledge sharing platform with microtransactions for specialized expertise.

USER STORY:
Developer Raj has deep knowledge in distributed systems but finds traditional tech writing poorly compensated. With Codex Protocol, he authors comprehensive technical guides that readers access through one-time cryptocurrency payments, creating passive income from his specialized knowledge.

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:
- Go backend with paywall middleware protecting premium content
- Interactive code sandboxes for demonstrations
- Version-controlled documentation with Git-like history
- Search functionality with preview snippets
- API access for enterprise integration

PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS:
- No tracking of reading patterns or user behavior
- Monero support for complete reader privacy
- Self-hostable for organizations with sensitive information
- Zero personal data requirements

MONETIZATION:
- Per-document access fees via cryptocurrency
- Subscription options for full library access
- Enterprise licensing for team access
- Author-defined pricing with market discovery

CULTURAL CONTEXT:
This evolves the traditional technical documentation model by incorporating elements of academic paywalls with the accessibility of platforms like Stack Overflow, while respecting the open-source ethos through fair compensation models for knowledge creators.

IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP:
1. Document management system (3 weeks)
2. Author dashboard with analytics (2 weeks)
3. Reader interface and search functionality (3 weeks)
4. Code sandbox integration (2 weeks)
5. Beta with technical writers (1 month)

RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS:
- 2 Go developers
- 1 Frontend developer
- Documentation parsing and rendering system
- Code execution environment (optional)
