CONCEPT 6: ARCANE ARCHIVE
A digital library platform for academic and specialized research papers with microtransaction access.

USER STORY:
Academic researcher Maya publishes specialized climate science papers but is frustrated with traditional journals' paywalls that don't compensate authors. With Arcane Archive, she publishes directly to readers who pay a small cryptocurrency fee that goes entirely to her, making specialized knowledge more accessible while fairly compensating creators.

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:
- Go backend with paywall middleware protecting PDF/HTML content
- Citation management system with DOI integration
- Full-text search with relevance scoring
- Annotation capabilities for researchers
- Reference management system integration (Zotero, Mendeley)

PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS:
- No tracking of reading patterns or citation networks
- Monero support for politically sensitive research access
- No personal data collection beyond wallet addresses
- Self-hostable for academic institutions

MONETIZATION:
- Per-paper access fees via cryptocurrency
- Author-defined pricing with suggested tiers
- Institutional subscription options
- Open access options with optional payment

CULTURAL CONTEXT:
This challenges the entrenched academic publishing model that extracts value from both authors and institutions, drawing inspiration from Sci-Hub's accessibility mission while creating a sustainable economic model that properly compensates knowledge creators.

IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP:
1. Document management and rendering system (3 weeks)
2. Researcher dashboard (2 weeks)
3. Search functionality (2 weeks)
4. Citation and reference management (3 weeks)
5. Beta with academic partners (2 months)

RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS:
