CONCEPT 2: CIPHER SCRIBE
A subscription journalism platform allowing writers to monetize investigative reporting directly from readers.

USER STORY:
Investigative journalist Elena covers corporate corruption but struggles with traditional media's declining budgets. With Cipher Scribe, she publishes directly to readers who support her work through cryptocurrency micropayments, either per article or via monthly subscriptions, while maintaining readers' anonymity.

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:
- Go backend with paywall middleware for article access
- Markdown-based publishing system with versioning
- Tiered access controls based on subscription level
- RSS feed generation with encrypted entry snippets
- Webhook notifications for subscriber updates

PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS:
- Reader anonymity through cryptocurrency payments
- No advertising trackers or analytics scripts
- PGP-encrypted communication channel between writers and sources
- No IP logging or browser fingerprinting

MONETIZATION:
- Subscription tiers (monthly Monero/Bitcoin payments)
- Pay-per-article microtransactions
- Optional tip jar for additional support
- Pre-funding for investigative projects

CULTURAL CONTEXT:
This reimagines the patron model of journalism that predates advertising-driven media, merging it with cypherpunk ideals of information freedom and privacy. It echoes Doctorow's vision of creator-supported media without surveillance capitalism.

IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP:
1. Content management system (3 weeks)
2. Subscription handling via paywall (2 weeks)
3. Writer dashboard with payment tracking (2 weeks)
4. Reader interface with subscription management (2 weeks)
5. Beta testing with select journalists (1 month)
